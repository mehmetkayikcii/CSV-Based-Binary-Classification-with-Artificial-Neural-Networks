# CSV-Based-Binary-Classification-with-Artificial-Neural-Networks
Prediction Based on CSV Data Using Artificial Neural Networks: This project aims to perform predictions using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on data from a CSV file. The ANN model, implemented entirely in Python from scratch, solves a binary classification problem.
